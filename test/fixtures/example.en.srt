00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,604
Dearest friends,
thank you for welcoming me

3
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:35,382
in the name of all "Abuelas
de Plaza de Mayo"; I'm just one of them.

4
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:40,700
And my story is the same
as my fellow women:

5
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:46,074
we got together deeply pained,
not knowing what to do,

6
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,954
lacking information, surrounded by danger,

7
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,349
and leaving everything behind.

8
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:58,996
I was a school principal but I retired
to search for a Disappeared loved one,

9
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:04,152
a child of mine, a daughter,
but it was a double search

10
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:09,212
because my daughter
was expecting a baby.

11
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:16,242
At my age, I was born in the 1930s,
dictatorships were part of my education,

12
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,164
but I never thought

13
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:24,793
that the last civic-military dictatorship

14
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,662
would bring such a horrifying
and sinister a project.

15
00:01:28,663 --> 00:01:30,641
I had to educate myself about it,

16
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,079
I had to learn about it and to understand,

17
00:01:34,779 --> 00:01:37,027
but we did something wonderful

18
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:41,130
which allowed us to keep on fighting:

19
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,094
we joined together.

20
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:48,378
Even if we stood alone, when we saw
there were other mothers out there,

21
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:53,143
with same faces and feeling the same pain,
we dared to ask what their stories were

22
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,915
and so we decided
to search for answers together.

23
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:01,268
This is how this group took shape

24
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,211
37 years ago.

25
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:09,824
And we are still getting together
- the ones who have survived -

26
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:13,177
because many of us passed away,
and others are ill.

27
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:19,186
We have different ideologies now,

28
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:22,686
a different culture or religion,

29
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,787
but there is still something
that unites us,

30
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:29,194
that common thread of pain,
that fight that never ends,

31
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,983
because I believe not a day goes by

32
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:35,375
that a mother doesn't love
her sons or daughters,

33
00:02:35,376 --> 00:02:39,118
especially if she has been searching
for her beloved son.

34
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:44,918
So we started by
getting together and searching

35
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:48,082
not knowing exactly where or how to do it.

36
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,707
We started searching for the babies
at first, but we got no answers.

37
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,702
They were never brought back to us.

38
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,196
We prepared our homes and the layettes,

39
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:02,590
but we soon left our families uncared for,

40
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:05,564
we swept our traditional gender roles

41
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:10,220
as mothers, as wives,
in my case my job as a teacher too,

42
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:14,618
and let our husbands
take care of the home;

43
00:03:14,619 --> 00:03:18,544
that's what we tell people who asked us
how were the grandfathers involved.

44
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:21,503
Well, they were there,
fulfilling domestic duties.

45
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:25,030
I think of them as anonymous heroes

46
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:29,667
because they were left to care

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:34,105
for the children at home,
provide as sole breadwinners,

48
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:37,163
and wait for us in silence

49
00:03:37,164 --> 00:03:42,073
because every time we went marching
they never knew if we were to come back.

50
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,820
I remember one time
I was a little discouraged

51
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:49,646
and said that I'd quit
with no apparent reason,

52
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:53,646
and my husband intervened and told me
that I couldn't, I had to go on,

53
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,316
because the Grandmothers needed me.

54
00:03:56,317 --> 00:04:01,716
It was the only time I felt like quitting,
but never again; on the contrary.

55
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:04,680
You know that I found my grandson,

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,656
we were reunited, we're living together!

57
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:09,132
(Applause)

58
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:10,898
What a moment!

59
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:20,646
But I want to let you know, to share
it with you: I didn't find him by myself.

60
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:25,290
I've got help from the Grandmothers,
from all of you, all this time

61
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:30,603
- the longest period in the history
of democracy here in Argentina -

62
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,253
because we got together
in a common understanding

63
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:38,023
the dictatorship's affected all of us,
and we must ensure it doesn't happen again

64
00:04:38,023 --> 00:04:41,719
and that we must find and get back
our kidnapped Disappeared alive.

65
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,292
So my grandson is everybody's grandson.

66
00:04:44,292 --> 00:04:47,165
See, something amazing happened:

67
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:53,299
there is a permanent smile on people's
faces in the country since that encounter.

68
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,346
It may be because of this woman's fight
for 37 years, out of love,

69
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:05,453
overcoming hatred and resentment,
hoping this doesn't happen again,

70
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:09,340
that our children will live
to be free, to be freethinkers,

71
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,361
and to learn how to disagree
but live together as brothers.

72
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:16,525
That's why I think
this multitudinous, wonderful event

73
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:20,979
we're attending in this cultural space

74
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,294
should foster coexistence
beyond differences.

75
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:30,717
The Grandmothers, 
even today argue on things,

76
00:05:30,718 --> 00:05:33,370
we have diverging views we don't agree on,

77
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:36,594
but when we have to come to a decision
we are resolving it together.

78
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,712
We know we are lucky,

79
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:43,770
but I sometimes say is funny
how one gets to thank life through pain.

80
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:48,404
For my daughter gave her life
knowing that things should change,

81
00:05:48,405 --> 00:05:50,428
and they are,

82
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:54,796
but there are many roads left unexplored.

83
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:56,776
One of them is science.

84
00:05:56,777 --> 00:06:00,876
There is no other genetic Data Bank
anywhere in the whole world but here

85
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:05,871
where grandparents can search
for their kidnapped grandchildren.

86
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:10,559
We are the only country with a history

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,117
in the search
of stolen babies, now adults.

88
00:06:15,118 --> 00:06:18,437
But what a joyous moment
when we are reunited!

89
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:22,911
The happiness!
I feel younger, I feel better.

90
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:28,110
Sometimes I feel like throwing this cane,
but I have to tell you that is a symbol

91
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:31,638
of all the Grandmothers,
because we never kneel down,

92
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,109
we are always marching head-high,
resolutely, determined and with dignity.

93
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,822
Because there is no need for violence
in order to have justice done.

94
00:06:41,823 --> 00:06:44,256
Justice is being done.

95
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,336
And I think we made a small contribution

96
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:53,305
to our current democracy
that we hope it will last forever.

97
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:57,854
(Applause)

98
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,190
In this brief talk
I wish you all the best.

99
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:16,307
If you are here, then I think
it's because you are those Argentineans

100
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:21,640
who deserve respect, to be heard,

101
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,538
and have their demands satisfied.

102
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:31,923
The most important thing
is not to be alone, not to give up.

103
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,173
Because perseverance
is the key of all triumphs.

104
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:41,161
37 years later I am here,

105
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:44,418
and I thank you today
for helping me find my grandson;

106
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,525
it's something worth fighting for.

107
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:51,200
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:53,846
(Applause)
